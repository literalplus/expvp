Expvp Minecraft Game Mode

Expvp is an advanced Minecraft player-vs-player game mode.
For combat action, players get talent points, which they
can spend in in-game skill trees to obtain special powers
and better items.

Expvp was initially written for the MinoTopia Minecraft server,
and was published at expvp.eu. Because of the huge pressure
from MinoTopia's community, it is compatible with Minecraft
1.8 and provides no official support for later versions.
